	At a National Press Club luncheon where he was a guest of honor, Trump was asked
	what he would do if dealing with Putin.
</p>
<p>
	He said, “Well, in negotiation, the primary thing that you have to do is to get
	the other side to respect you. And President Putin does not respect, or like,
	President Obama. So you have a problem. I’m not sure that’s a problem that's
	easily solvable, there’s a dislike. But Russia does not respect our country any
	longer. They see that we’ve been greatly weakened both militarily and otherwise.
	And he certainly does not respect President Obama. So, what I would do would be,
	as an example, I own the Miss Universe. I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently,
	and I spoke indirectly and directly with President Putin, who could not have been
	nicer. And we had a tremendous success. The show was live from Moscow and we had
	a tremendous success there. And it was amazing. But to do well, you have to get
	the other side to respect you, and he does not respect our president, which is
	very sad.”
