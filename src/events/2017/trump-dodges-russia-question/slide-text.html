  Trump did not respond to the final question of his first news conference since
  the convention when asked if he could affirmatively state that no one connected
  to him or his campaign had contact with Russia during the campaign.

  Ann Compton of ABC News asked: “Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today,
  once and for all, and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any
  contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign?” Jim
  Acosta indicated that Trump answered "no" as he was leaving.
