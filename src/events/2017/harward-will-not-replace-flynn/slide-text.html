  Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward declines Trump's offer to replace Michael
  Flynn as National Security Adviser after Flynn resigned.
</p>
<p>
  Sources state that Harward declined the role due to financial and family
  considerations. Additionally, it is reported Trump insisted on retaining
  pro-Russia Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland. In 2013, McFarland
  made a statement that Putin should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Harward,
  however, wanted to choose his own staff.
